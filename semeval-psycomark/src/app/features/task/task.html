  <h2>Task Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The PsyCoMark task is divided into two synergistic subtasks designed to promote generalizable, interpretable models for conspiracy theory detection.
  </p>

  <h3>Subtask 1: Conspiracy Marker Extraction</h3>
  <p>
    Identify spans of text that express core conspiracy markers grounded in evolutionary psychology. Each document may include zero or multiple overlapping spans. Evaluation will use an overlap-based macro F1-score for each marker.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Actor</strong> – Mentions of individual or group agents.</li>
    <li><strong>Action</strong> – Descriptions of what the actor is doing.</li>
    <li><strong>Effect</strong> – Consequences of the actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Victim</strong> – Individuals or groups being harmed.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence</strong> – Claims or proof used to support the theory.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Subtask 2: Conspiracy Detection</h3>
  <p>
    Classify Reddit comments as either <em>conspiracy-related</em> or <em>not conspiracy-related</em>. The task is designed to benefit from the extracted markers but can be approached independently. Performance will be evaluated using macro-averaged F1-score.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participants are encouraged (but not required) to build joint models for both subtasks.
