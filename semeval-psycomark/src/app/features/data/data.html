  <h2>The PsyCoMark Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    The PsyCoMark dataset is a novel resource for researchers and NLP practitioners focused on understanding and detecting conspiracy-related content in online conversations. It's built from Reddit submission statements and is ideal for identifying <strong>psycholinguistic markers</strong> of conspiracy beliefs.

  <h2>Dataset Statistics</h2>
  <p>
    This dataset contains over <strong>4,800</strong> annotated entries, comprising over <strong>4,100</strong> unique Reddit submission statements from more than <strong>190</strong> subreddits.
  </p>

  <h3>Annotation Coverage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unique Comments:</strong> There are over <strong>4,100</strong> unique Reddit submission statements.</li>
    <li><strong>Annotation Depth:</strong> The dataset includes approximately <strong>4,800</strong> annotations in total. Around <strong>3,500</strong> comments have a single annotation, <strong>550</strong> have two, and <strong>50</strong> have more.</li>
    <li><strong>Marker Density:</strong> Approximately <strong>4,000</strong> comments have at least one psycholinguistic marker annotation.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1,300</strong> comments contain all five marker types.</li>
        <li><strong>1,200</strong> comments have four marker types.</li>
        <li><strong>900</strong> comments have three marker types.</li>
        <li><strong>400</strong> comments have two marker types.</li>
        <li><strong>180</strong> comments have one marker type.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Label Distribution</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Conspiracy Detection:</strong> The distribution of the binary conspiracy labels is well-balanced for the training data, with a near-equal number of "Yes" and "No" labels.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes (Conspiracy):</strong> 1,715 instances.</li>
        <li><strong>No (Not Conspiracy):</strong> 2,263 instances.</li>
        <li><strong>Can't Tell:</strong> 877 instances.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Marker Extraction:</strong> The dataset includes five types of psycholinguistic markers:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Actor:</strong> 3,639 instances.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> 3,601 instances.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> 2,916 instances.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> 2,854 instances.</li>
        <li><strong>Victim:</strong> 2,378 instances.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Inter-annotator agreement:</strong> The Krippendorff’s α for the binary conspiracy labels is 0.58, indicating a moderate level of agreement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Composition and Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The PsyCoMark dataset is composed of Reddit submission statements—user-written summaries of media submissions. The data was collected between January and March 2025, but the submission statements themselves span from March 2013 to December 2023.
  </p>

  <h3>Sampling Strategy</h3>
  <p>
    The dataset is a <strong>sample</strong> of Reddit submission statements, not a comprehensive collection. To ensure a sufficient number of conspiracy-related examples, a specific sampling strategy was employed.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The dataset oversamples comments that are likely to contain conspiracy theories.</li>
    <li>Approximately <strong>1,150</strong> comments (1/4 of the total) were sourced from the <code>r/conspiracy</code> subreddit.</li>
    <li>The remaining comments were taken from other subreddits with at least ten submission statements.</li>
    <li>This oversampling means the dataset is not representative of the overall prevalence of conspiracy theories on Reddit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preprocessing and Annotation</h3>
  <p>
    The raw data underwent several preprocessing steps to prepare it for annotation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Comments were filtered to a length of 160 to 1,000 characters.</li>
    <li>Markdown formatting was converted to plain text, and URLs were replaced with the token <code>[URL]</code>.</li>
    <li>Any comments containing quotes were removed to focus on the original author's text.</li>
    <li>The annotation was performed by native English-speaking crowdworkers on the platform <strong>Prolific</strong>, who were paid an average of over £9 per hour.</li>
    <li>Each submission statement was annotated with a binary conspiracy label (<strong>conspiracy</strong>, <strong>not conspiracy</strong>, or <strong>can't tell</strong>) and span-level markers for five psychological mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Potential Uses</h2>
  <p>
    This dataset is designed for a variety of tasks related to computational social science and natural language processing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Training models</strong> for conspiracy detection and marker extraction.</li>
    <li><strong>Studying the linguistic signals</strong> of conspiratorial thinking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-topic analysis</strong> of conspiracy-related discourse.</li>
    <li><strong>Explaining and interpreting model decisions</strong> by leveraging marker spans.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    ⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> The dataset oversamples conspiratorial content and should not be used to measure the overall prevalence of conspiracy theories on Reddit or beyond.
